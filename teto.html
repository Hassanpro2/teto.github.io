        <p>Search's introduction:<br>
            The information technology appeared with our technical century we have computer science this science helping us to develop our life by get more of information so we should learning more and more the life do not stop it is continue always we full of problems and want create some thing to develop our life and pass from this problem so we want more information
            </p>
            <p>
                The search's article:<br>
                The concept of information: we always hear that concept of information is very complex but why we don't search about the reason of this complex we always using the information in our life with anything we say that information is complex because it has a wide meaning the life developing  by sciences and knowledge also we can't have any knowledge without information because the information is base of knowledge the information word coming from the science word so we can say that science is a group of information so when we say that person is scientist this person will be have much of information about some sciences for example there is invention called pen of course I talk about this invention that we use it for write so we can ask our self how is it work ? to answer about this question  we should be know some information about this invent the answer will be that inside the pen found the tube carry a liquid ink and this ink is liquid to hand out on the paper` from the beginning of the tube we see head of pen this head has a full control of the ink ok I think that this example was very simple but we can imagine that pen was data when we do processes for this data we get about the information so we always say there are connection between data, information and the knowledge also we can say there are information convert to data then when we processes it we get new 
                information I call this nested information for example if we want to know any stranger thing the beginning we ask
                what is that then when anyone answer our question, we will know the first point from his information step number two we asking what is his work to we know more information about it the last step we asking what does consists of? to we know all information about it
                the information has special properties we can sent it or receive it we see that with questions or when we read some books the information does not end also the people know that we always need more information and our information does not enough
                it is very easy to copy and accept the fusion with another information 
                types of information systems: when we talk about information also we talk about part of some science we know that there are much more type of science there are science explain the space or medicine and physics or math we should be know the types of information systems these types are  ( information management systems – database management systems – decision support system – geographic information system - Information retrieval systems ) ok we will start by geographic information system this system help us to processed geographic data and save it then we can use it to draw 2d map or 3d map this is not enough the company of shipping or transfer always using this system because the process of transfer can't without geographic information system because this system collect information about the places also we can planning for the towns or villages with this system there are something called layers using to check of ground if it was strong or weak and more that but let's talk about decision support system at the beginning we should be know that system help the managers to  talk a good decision for their work or their organization this system depend on statistical operations and artificial intelligence this system searching about information inside database that is not structure  like content of social media networks or a short blogging the decision support system is very important there are more information about it but I say that let's talk about another type this type will be management information systems this system solving the difference problem and has much of specializations do help inside every side in the life any one graduated from management information systems he can work in marketing information system or MKIS the worker in the part collect the marketing information and data to save it when the managers want to know this information this worker give the data for them we can say that marketing information systems is structure for group of procedures or styles also anyone 

                graduated from management information systems can that work as manager of networks this person has a good ability to find the problem and solve it or he fixed the network and develop it or manage the server and his operating system also he can work as programmer to make mobile apps like google map that help us to arrive anywhere or uber this app help us to found a good transform anywhere or anytime also he can make mobile games like subway this game has more than one billion download it is very successfully this programmer can make website like youtube we always use it help us to learn more it has a big database there are a lot of free courses about programming or design and kitchen or technology he can make a marketing website like jumia or souq and amazon he can make operating system at the past we was work with old operating system like dos but know after we have more knowledge we work with operating system has graphical user interface like windows from Microsoft I think that programmer is like hero of our life he makes it very easy there is another type of information system like database management systems this field important to collect the data and make filtered or processed for it we know that now all types of information systems have a connections between them this connection is the save for data, processed, filtered and they allow to users get the information at any time the information technology is very important I say that search explain 2% only about the information technology but I think this is enough to take idea about it.
